skies low over the Serbian Countryside the pilot is Lieutenant Colonel Daryl zalo and his mission is to bomb the command center of the Serbian Air Force in belra it's the headquarters of the force that's going to try and stop him on his mission tonight zalo is escorted by F-16 vipers with missiles that can lock on and Destroy enemy radar as he approaches a Serbian border he hears a command come over the radio this is Joint Forces air component Commander because of the bad weather the escorting vipers are ordered to immediately turn back and return to base he's on his own if he's to make it home safely he has to remain undetected a ghost fortunately he's in the most advanced operational fighter bomber that has ever flown the nigh HW stal capabilities make the 65- Ft long bomber appear on radar as if it was the size of a tennis ball allowing it so far to go unchallenged in every mission that is every Mission until this one on the ground an anti-air missile battery is waiting for him it's under command of Lieutenant Colonel zultan Dany Serbian spies have let him know that the enemy aircraft are coming and he thinks today is his best chance to take down one of the elusive ghosts sweep the skies Danny orders and the p18 early warning radar comes to life they think at its lowest frequency it may be capable of detecting the enemy planes but it also detects clouds and Rain resulting in a screen covered in fake signals but looking closely Danny sees something one tiny dot moving through the masses of clouds a tiny dot headed right towards [Music] them zal's nwk speeds towards its objective the computer preparing the drop hide them Danny double checks the low frequency radar he can see the target it's right in front of them but he needs a Sam radar to get a lock the men scan the sky just as instructed yet the screens remain dead but then zalco opens his Bombay increasing the nigh Hawk's radar signature just at the wrong moment on two missiles fire off the launcher in quick succession streaking across the sky zalo drops his bombs they follow the path designated by the laser and explode he Soares past the target it's another mission success and he ascends to 6 km but a few seconds later his cockpit is filled with the whale of an urgent alarm and his controls light up it's a lock alert almost at the same time he sees the two missiles illuminate the clouds below him and then break through they're coming right at him he immediately breaks into evasive maneuvers he pulls his aircraft up to try and Escape he's pushed into his seat as he ascends as the aircraft screams more warnings at him the F-117 has no chaf so with the missile locked on it's entirely on the Pilot's actions to try and evade the threat time slows he knows it's over they got me these are proximity missiles and should detonate near the aircraft somehow the first missile malfunctions and Races by his canopy the second Miss Salvo doesn't malfunction it explodes sending out a cloud of sharp shrapnel that perforates the left wing of his nwk the entire left side is blasted to Pieces Illuminating the night sky a fiery orange the aircraft immediately loses control and is thrown into a wild spin as the plane spins zalo is pinned to his seat and experiences severe G forces the spin increases in violence flashing warnings illuminate his controls and a bright flame shines through the cockpit Windows as the landscape spins around him he knows he's in a critical situation even ejection might prove fatal but it's his only choice he fights s GS of Force 100 lb pulling up on each of his arms fueled by adrenaline he gets hold of the ejection handles and pulls in the blink of an eye the canopy is blasted away and his seat Rockets out of the cockpit for one and a half almost Eternal seconds zalco free falls through the air stuck to his chair he's barely conscious and he thinks that the seat's still inside the plane and that the ejection seat has malfunctioned but then he feels the tug of the opening parachute and sees his burning Nighthawk tumbling away into the night the violence of the spinning wreck is replaced by a total calm zalo breathes heavily as he takes it all in he's alive but then another thought hits him man mom is not going to be happy about this he knows the enemy are going to be searching for him if he can't fall to the ground unseen he can still get rescued and get back home with no further complications but then he looks up he notices his parachute is Sprite orange he might as well be waving a flare with his hopes of going unseen dashed he takes out his survival radio to report he's alive and well mayday mayday mayday Vega 31 Vega 31 going down to his massive relief the MayDay is heard Vega 31 magic copies your Mayday last position Vega 31 last position in aircraft point after Target zco sees a ditch from above he doesn't get to say much more before hitting the ground he's now alone deep Behind Enemy Lines zalo runs for the ditch he saw on the way down he quickly paints himself with mud and tries to hide as he awaits rescue news of the down plane quickly spreads serbians waste no time and rapidly initiate a search all around him the activity gains momentum as more and more men appear men of the Serbian Army comb the area gradually joined by local policemen and civilians as the news spreads everybody wants to find him flashlights illuminate the fields and trucks roll past on the nearby Highway zalo can do nothing but sit and pray then he hears a rustle in the undergrowth getting louder just outside his ditch someone is searching he stays still and quiet like a rock quieting his breath he hears panting and snuffling it's a dog slowly and carefully zalo pulls out his knife the dog gets closer he weighs his options should he kill the dog if he did could he do it silently he finally makes up his mind to spare the dog reasoning that if he did kill it the owner would be quick to follow then toal's massive relief the dog turns jumps up and leaves the radio crackles to life S1 mea 31 over zal's eyes go wide they're here go ahead sandy1 over Vega 3 want is it okay to come down there zco doesn't respond he Peaks out of his hiding spot searching the area for threats flashlights shine in the distance fig 31 if you don't answer we're going to try this later he makes his decision yeah okay let's go for it zalo turns on his infrared strobe as a chopper races into the area but the Dro fails and the helicopter can't see him he curses his luck and desperately checks for threats he has a backup but it's nowhere near as subtle but it's now or never zalo makes a quick [Music] decision and Pops a [Applause] flare bright light spills all around him and illuminates the area pointing out his position for the rescue helicopter and the enemy alike there he is the helicopter sweeps in rapidly as the enemy also closes in at the same time in the distance flashlights from enemy patrols are all pointed towards the flare but then another transmission comes through the radio snuff your flare it blinds our night vision thinking quickly zalo rushes to take the flare and dunk it in the mud just as the rescue helicopter comes into land right in front of him and is greeted by an American Rescue Team hey your feelings sir great now let's get out of here the field is blasted with wind as a helicopter Rises up into the air and exits a scene with just seconds to spare before the enemy spills over the landing site Zan Dany and his crew to this day remember the only team to have downed a stal aircraft in combat when talking about the incident Danny would later say when it hit it felt very [Music] good the US didn't destroy the wreck and the Serbian forces salvaged the mortally wounded Nighthawk unimpeded and today you can still see pieces of zal's aircraft in the museum of aviation in Belgrade zalo always expressed a desire to find the man who shot him down and congratulate him he finally got his wish in 2011 just 12 years after the incident the end of the 20th century was packed with Unforgettable military stories here's another one what many call the last tank battle of the century [Music]"}INFO:youtube_backend:Video info: ID=Zd88lzCWjpA, Title=How a Nighthawk Was Shot Down
