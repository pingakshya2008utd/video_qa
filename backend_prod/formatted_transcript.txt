00:00 - 00:12
Do you know what makes a true difference between a powerful AI agent's AI workflow versus a simple AI chatbot? That is the ability to access and use external tools. Well, most LLM today are.

00:11 - 00:23
Decided to handle back-and-forth conversations. True AI agents can connect to your calendar, database, email, any service, or tools your business uses and perform the task on the.

00:21 - 00:36
Fly! And the technology making this possible and scalable at the same time is MCP (Model Context Protocol). So, in this video, I explain everything you need to know about MCP, including.

00:33 - 00:45
Practical demos. So, you know why MCP is a big piece for building powerful AI workflows or AI agents. Let's go. So, what is MCP? By definition, MCP is an.

00:43 - 00:57
Open-source protocols standardize how applications provide context to LLM. And let me explain this. Before MCP, connecting AI to your business tools or system is like trying to lead a team.

00:55 - 01:09
Where everyone speaks a different language. Imagine your AI needs to get data from Salesforce. It has to learn to speak Salesforce. And then for it to understand your company, Google Analytics, your AI needs to learn.

01:07 - 01:20
Completely different language. Each connection is like a custom one-off translation project. You or your team has to act as an individual translator, teaching the AI how to communicate with.

01:17 - 01:32
Each one by one. And this is using what we call the traditional API method. Of course, this method works 100%. But the biggest problem is because AI is changing so fast. This method simply.

01:30 - 01:44
Doesn't scale. When the AI model changes or a new AI model rolls out, imagine you have 10 different tools. You are managing 10 separate conversations. So that's why the solution we have is MCP.

01:42 - 01:56
Think of it like a universal translator for the AI. Instead of AI learning 10 different languages, it only needs to learn one, the language of MCP. And so when service providers also adopt MCP.

01:54 - 02:09
They all speak the same standard language and save much of your custom integration efforts. And even better, your AI applications now become model agnostic. That means you can swap your.

02:06 - 02:21
AI models at any time from chat GBT, Gemini, Claw to any future model that support MCP without rebuilding the integration from scratch. So that's why MCP is the critical infrastructure for.

02:18 - 02:32
AI agents or AI workflows is a technology empowering AI from a simple chatbot into a scalable business system. Now let's quickly understand how MCP actually works. The simplified way to.

02:30 - 02:42
Understand the architecture is having the two main components. The MCP server and the MCP client with a host. Think of it like this. We have MCP servers. These are the business tools that provide.

02:40 - 02:54
Capabilities like your business tools database. And then you have MCP clients. These are the AI applications that use this tool like Claw or Chat GBT. So when the client says, "I need to grab this."

02:52 - 03:06
Company data. The server will respond and return the data. MCP is like the universal translator between them. MCP servers can run remotely on the cloud or locally on your computer. And I would.

03:04 - 03:18
Say remote MCP servers are becoming more popular as MCP is now widely adopted and supported by AI companies. They are more simple to set up. Just paste the link and you're good to go. While local MCP.

03:15 - 03:28
Servers are more secure but require more technical setup, and generally, there are four ways to connect your AI system to MCP servers. Here is how to choose the right approach for your needs. First.

03:26 - 03:40
Native integration is your lowest risk option. Popular AI apps like Chatbot Claw now offer built-in MCB connectors to tools like Gmail, Calendar, Google Drive. So, choose this when you need.

03:38 - 03:52
Reliability and want zero technical setup. But they also have some limitations for now, which I will talk about in a minute. And second, official MCP servers from service providers like Notion, Hotspot, Perplexity. So more.

03:50 - 04:04
Companies are building their own MCP servers for your local or remote installation. So choose this when the native integration is not available or can't do what you want, and you want maximum reliability and security.

04:02 - 04:16
Can you check the full list from the official MCP GitHub page? Third, the community builds MCP servers for specialized tools like Airtable, which currently does not have an official MCP service. Basically, these are servers.

04:14 - 04:29
Maintained by some individuals from the community. You have to bear the potential security risk of using them, like potential data leakage, prom injection. So, choose this only when you need capabilities not covered by the.

04:27 - 04:40
Official options, but understand there is a higher risk and less support. There are different MCP marketplaces or registries where you can explore different MCB servers for your needs, like Smithery.

04:37 - 04:49
MCP market. MCP is so awesome! MCP servers. I'll put all the links below. And fourth custom MCB service you build yourself, like using no-code platforms. If you are.

04:47 - 05:00
A developer, you can also build one using Python SDK or the JavaScript SDK. So choose this when you have a unique business requirement or proprietary system that needs custom integration.

04:58 - 05:12
My recommendation is always to start with native integration. Then, official servers only. Move to community or custom solutions when necessary. And always grant the minimal necessary permission.

05:09 - 05:23
For security reasons, now besides MCP servers, we also have MCP clients. They are simply the AI applications you're already using today. Good news is that most of the popular AI, like chat GBT.

05:21 - 05:34
Gemini, Claw, Windsurf, and Kursza offer support to MCP. Claw still offers the best MCP support. CHBT has added the MCP connector so you can connect to different tools. For now.

05:32 - 05:46
This only works during chat search or deep research mode. That means CHBT can read and analyze data from your tools, but it cannot create, edit, or send anything. As for Gemini, the current MCP.

05:44 - 05:58
Support is only available through the use of Google's Gemini API within the SDK. But don't get disappointed. I believe things will keep changing. These AI companies are adding more support to MCP. It's just a matter of time. Now.

05:56 - 06:10
Let me show you how to actually install an MCP server for tools or data assets so you can extend the capabilities for AI workflows or AI agents. Let's start with the easiest and the safest option.

06:08 - 06:22
Official integration. So on Chat GBT, you can just go to Settings > Connectors, and you will see a list of available MCP connectors like Gmail, Calendar, Hotspot. You can just click the app that you want.

06:19 - 06:32
And establish the MCP connections. For example, I can connect CHBT to my Gmail. But as I said, unlike the one on Claw, currently the functions are limited to deep research only. And that means you.

06:30 - 06:44
Can only let Chat GBT retrieve data from your Gmail but are not able to do actions like sending emails or driving emails. So once the connection is done, you can see it will not appear under the tools, but you will need to select the.

06:42 - 06:57
Did research function first and then turn on the Gmail source. So, that means each prompt will be treated as a deep research request and use up a quota. And so you can ask to pull any relevant data and start generating the deep research.

06:55 - 07:10
Report. So in this case, I'll ask it to retrieve all my AI-related newsletters in my inbox for the past six months. Then it will ask you some questions, just like a typical deep research request. So imagine if your organization has a big.

07:08 - 07:22
Knowledge base. So, it is powerful to turn chatbot into a deep research agent that connects to your company source and organizes insights. And this is exactly what makes the agent powerful. For this.

07:20 - 07:34
In case it will even link back to the exact email that I received. But again, for most charges now, these connectors mainly support deep research functions. So use it only when you have a really big.

07:31 - 07:45
Repository to fully maximize its power. Now, in case there is no such native MCP integration offer, you can consider using an official MCP server or community build server, and you need to.

07:43 - 07:57
Install locally, and I always recommend using the official MCP server for security reasons. They're more well-maintained than from the original service provider. So, I'm on the official MCP GitHub page. Just look.

07:55 - 08:08
Through if your desired tool is on the list. But note, this method currently only works for Clock Desktop. For example, Notion has their official MCB server, and I want to enable my LLM to.

08:06 - 08:18
Call Notion. Then I can just follow the instructions to this repository. Note, different MCB servers might have different instructions, but they're more or less the same, which usually involve.

08:16 - 08:30
Generating the service token and adding the MCP config to your LLM. So, first, we will create the integrations on Notion, set up a new integration by giving it a name, and then we can configure the.

08:28 - 08:42
Integration settings. So here we can grant the necessary permission. My tip is just grant the functions that you only need. For demo purpose, I will keep the default and then also go to access.

08:40 - 08:54
So here, you can specify which pages these MCP server connections have access to. Let's say I wanted to access only my internal branch key guidelines. And of course, you can click more than that.

08:52 - 09:06
And here is the token. So, this will be used to establish the connections to this MCP server in the LLM. Copy it, and we will use it later. Now, following the instructions, the next step is to.

09:04 - 09:17
Add the MCP config to the configuration file. So on Clock desktop, go to Settings under Developer. If you don't have any tools installed, it should look blank. Click "Addit Config." Now it.

09:15 - 09:30
Will bring you to the configuration file and open it using any editor. Paste this config according to the instructions and replace the parameters with the API keys we just generated. Note.

09:27 - 09:41
Since this method uses the MPX command, whether you are a PC or Mac user, you must first install the Node.js package. I'll put the link below and then click.

09:39 - 09:52
Save. Now, create the clock application and restart again. If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to see the Notion tool appear here. If not, it's usually because there is a syntax error in.

09:50 - 10:04
Your configuration file. You can just ask AI to fix it for you. Let's say I'm preparing a social media brief for a pilot launch. And this is the notion page we just gave the MCP access to.

10:01 - 10:16
Brand kit with our brand style guide, target audience details, etc. This is just like a knowledge hub shared across the team. Then, on Claw, we can use this prompt to honestly generate the brief by following our brand voice.

10:13 - 10:28
And target persona information. Very important, if you haven't set any custom instructions or use a project, you should specify what tool it should use in the prompt; otherwise, it may not get it. And then you can see, it will prompt.

10:26 - 10:40
To ask for the connection permission, and then immediately it will generate the brief for you. And the best thing is, it will pull back all the shared information like the brand voice, brand color palette we store on Notion.

10:38 - 10:52
Generated response will be much more relevant to your brand. So, you can think about what external data tool that will benefit your workflow, and you can follow this same method and add it to your LLM.

10:49 - 11:03
And this is how you can enable agent behavior. You can always review the assets and turn off those functions you don't want the agent to access, just leaving those really necessary. All.

11:01 - 11:15
Right. In case there's no official native integrations, no available MCB servers for your desired tool, you can consider building a custom MCB server. Of course, as a non-technical myself. An.

11:12 - 11:27
Is my first choice as it's a no-cook platform. So, on an end, we will create a new workflow. Now, add an MCP server trigger and do not change any setting yet. Back to the canvas. Now we can.

11:24 - 11:39
Add the tools to this MCP server. The server already offers integrations for different popular services or data sources like Asana, Airtable, Google Analytics. For this demo, let's just.

11:37 - 11:50
Pick Google Analytics. For whatever tools you connect to this MCP server, you must first establish the connections with your service account. So, in this case, is my GA account connection.

11:47 - 12:02
Then we can select the parameter details to configure what assets this MCB server will get. Different tools have different settings. In this case, things like the GA account property default day.

11:59 - 12:12
Range metrics dimensions. And there are so many different metrics you can pull. So just select which metrics that you need. So this server will have access. Once you're satisfied, we are ready for the.

12:10 - 12:24
Next step, so you can see this custom MCP server now connects to this GA4 for get reports function. You can always add more tools, connections, or functions as well, like getting Google Sheets data.

12:22 - 12:34
Updating Google Sheets, etc. To make this work, we need to first activate this workflow and then click the MCP server. Under the MCP URL, you will see there.

12:31 - 12:45
Is a production URL, and this is your remote MCP server URL. So, copy it as we are going to add to LLM. Now, the best news is Clog just announced the support.

12:42 - 12:55
Of custom integration, so you no longer need to use Clot locally in order to access your remote MCP server. So on Clot web app, you can now click here to.

12:53 - 13:06
Add any custom integration. Here you will see a list of existing integrations. Click "Add Integration" and here you can add your remote MCP server URL.

13:03 - 13:18
Let's call it an EndMC server and then paste the URL. Then the MCP server is added here. It is very simple. Now you can directly call your custom MCP server from Claw to access the tool. If you're.

13:15 - 13:30
Using ChargeBT, it also has similar functions of adding your custom MCB server. But for now, it's just for higher-tier plans like Pro Plan or Teams Plan. It only supports custom MCB server that does deep research or file.

13:28 - 13:43
Retrieval. So keep this in mind. Now let's ask Cloud to generate a dashboard by retrieving the Google Analytics data. Again, we might look to use this tool since we're not running the prompt inside the project. So, it will prompt.

13:40 - 13:55
To access these, an MCP server, we just add. And then in a minute, the dashboard is ready with the specified brand tone, charts, metrics. So, this is a game changer. You can now directly.

13:53 - 14:06
Call this remote MCB server, retrieve data, generate quick insights or dashboard within your workflows, or equip your agents to do this. So you don't need to go back and forth between your.

14:04 - 14:17
Surface account. A bonus tip is: do not connect too many different types of tools to an MCP server. Try to limit to no more than five, because more tools might confuse your agents and might make the.

14:15 - 14:28
Process less effective. So, you can see why MCP will make your AI workflows or AI agents 10x more powerful if they have access to the right tools with scalable technology. And this will help.
